# Chapter 5: Modules and the Base library
Up until now, we have only covered basic operations that are pre-built into the language such as additions, subtractions, and concatenation. To execute more intricate operations, we need to import and utilize modules, particularly those found in the Base library.

Modules, are a grouping of named variables, functions, types that collectively serve a specific purpose. Modules aid us in organizing our code. Ordinarily, a module is defined in its own distinct source file, which can be imported into another Motoko file. The Base library is a set of modules that provide functions for commonly used types (such as `Bool`, `Nat`, `Int`, `Text` and more..).

The source code for this library is available on GitHub and is maintained by engineers from the DFINITY foundation and community members.
Each module has its own documentation page, where you can learn about the available functions. For example, here is [the documentation page for the `Nat` module](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/base/Nat).
