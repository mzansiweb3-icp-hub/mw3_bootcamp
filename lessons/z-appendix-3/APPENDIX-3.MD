<img src="./assets/cover.png"  style="width: 100%;"/>

## Introduction

Congratulation for making it this far. You've finished the foundational course and you can be proud of you, but keep in mind that this was only the beginning. The rest of the story belongs to you.

## Keep building üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Whatever happens, keep buildin. There's only one way forward and that's the correct one. We have a lot of ressources to help you on your journey.

### Option 1: Keep building your project üèóÔ∏è

Since you already have the foundation. Why not keep building on top of it? Here are some suggestions:

- Add a frontend to your project.
- Improve the voting system to allow for more complex voting scenarios and long-term incentives.
- Create a treasury for the DAO and allow members to vote on how to spend the funds.
- Read more about the [SNS framework](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns) and see how you can leverage it to raise funds and expand your DAO.

### Option 2: Start a new project üöÄ

DAOs are not the only thing you can build with Motoko. You can build anything you want. Here are some suggestions:

- Start your own NFT collection.
- Build a decentralized social network.
- Build a decentralized exchange or a decentralized marketplace.
- Build a game.

There are no limits to what you can build. Only your imagination.
Here are some inspirations from previous students:

### Option 3: Join a team and contribute to an existing project ü§ù

In the Motoko Bootcamp Discord, we have a section dedicated to builders. This is where you can find projects that are building in the open. Some of them are looking for contributors.

- Take a look the [Builders](https://discord.gg/YVTpqfaFwC) channel on Discord.

<p align="center"> <img src="./assets/grant_program.png"  style="border: 1px solid black; width: 500px;"/> </p>

DFINITY operates a [developer grant program](https://dfinity.org/grants) to support those building on the Internet Computer platform. If you have an idea and want to develop on the IC, you can request funding, which can range from $5,000 to $100,000 (though first-time applicants are unlikely to receive $100,000). The grant program focuses on the following areas:

- Canister Development Kits (CDKs) & Agents.
- Developer Tooling (such as IDEs, debuggers, and logging libraries).
- Infrastructure (including oracles and asset bridges).
- Integrations & APIs (e.g., chat, email, maps).
- Apps & Open Internet Services.

Additionally, DFINITY has announced a specific $5 million program to support the intersection of AI and blockchain technology, as detailed [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dfinity-foundation-launches-5-million-grant-to-support-decentralized-ai-on-the-internet-computer-blockchain-301877065.html).

DFINITY also offers a grant program for [educational and community initiatives](https://dfinity.org/community-grants). If you have an idea for a hackathon, workshop, or other community event, you can apply for a grant to secure funding.

Note: Please make sure to mention that you were referred by the Motoko Bootcamp when applying for a grant. Additionally, we are available to assist you with your grant application.
