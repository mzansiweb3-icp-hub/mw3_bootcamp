# Chapter 13: Accessing to a canister through our browser.
## Difference between HTTP request & HTTP outcalls.
In this chapter, we will cover how canisters can be accessed through HTTP requests. This is a separate topic from **HTTP Outcalls**:

- HTTP Request: Canisters can handle incoming requests and serve web pages.
- HTTP Outcalls: Canisters can send requests and communicate with the Web 2.0 world. This can be used for various use cases, such as querying an exchange for token prices, getting the latest weather information, and sending notifications to users.

Whenever you [access a canister](https://wujxq-qqaaa-aaaaj-qazca-cai.raw.ic0.app/) through your browser there are a few steps involved. Let's go through all of them.
You will notice that URLs on the Internet Computer are of the following form: <CANISTER_ID>.ic0.app The .ic0.app indicates that you are reaching out to [boundary nodes]().

## What are boundary nodes?
Canisters are hosted and executed by nodes that participate in the IC consensus However, those nodes are not directly accessible by end users.
To protect the consensus nodes & improve performance there is a layer of boundary nodes which serve different useful purposes:

- Translate the HTTP request of the user's browser to canister call. This part is called the HTTP Gateway protocol. When canisters send their response the gateway will convert it back to an HTTP request.
- Route the calls to the correct subnet running the canister. To properly route those calls the boundary nodes have to keep track of the entire configuration of the Internet Computer:
    - List of subnets.
    - List of nodes and which subnet they belong to.
    - The canisters run by each subnet.
- Load balancing among the subnet's replica nodes (i.e if a replica is lagging behind and has already a lot of work on its plate - boundary nodes will send the request to another replica).
- Protect subnets from DDoS attacks.

> Currently, boundary nodes are run by the DFINITY Foundation. However, the objective ([as part of the roadmap](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/boundary-node-roadmap/15562)) is to have anyone able to set up and run a boundary nodes. This will make interaction with the Internet Computer more reactive for end users and this will make the platform more robust to censorship.

## The asset canister
To serve web content on the Internet Computer, a canister should have a method that can handle an `http_request`, which includes the URL, HTTP method, and headers, and produce an HTTP response, consisting of a status, headers, and body. There are two ways to go about that:

- Implement the http_request method and all associated logic yourself.  
- Use the provided **asset** canister: this is a special canister whose code has been already implemented by DFINITY. You need to specify the type of this canister in `dfx.json` & add the source folder of your web app. Once the asset canister is deployed on the Internet Computer the website can be accessed at `http://<canister id>.ic0.app` and `http://<canister id>.raw.ic0.app`. The frontend canister that is shipped when you deploy a project with `dfx new <project>` is an asset canister (as you can confirm by looking at `dfx.json`).

> You can access [the source code for this canister written in Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/tree/master/src/canisters/frontend/ic-frontend-canister) under the [DFINITY organization](https://github.com/dfinity).  
## The differences between ic0.app & raw.ic0.app
As we've said earlier there are two ways to access a canister:
- raw.ic0.app: the raw URL raw URL will simply return the request as it is so serves the asset files (HTML, CSS, Javascript).
- ic0.app: uses a service worker to verify the content served by the boundary node. The service worker is loaded and then handles requests, verifying the signature of the assets served by the canister using the public key on the Internet Computer.

<p align="center"> Loading the service worker...</p>

When accessing a webpage, speed is a key factor. This is why we use query calls to handle http_request. However, it's important to note that query calls do not go through a consensus process and cannot create signatures. To address this issue, we use certified variables. This means that the content must be certified prior to the call being made. In some cases, this certification process may not be possible and if you are accessing a website under ic0.app, you may encounter an error page as a result.

<p align="center"> <img src="./img/body_no_verification.png" width="800px" style="border: 2px solid black;"> </p>

<p align="center" > In that case you should access under raw.ic0.app to avoid the issue.</p>

> It's worth noting that the service worker received when accessing ic0.app could potentially be altered by the boundary node to certify incorrect responses. This is a potential issue since most users won't take the time to verify the authenticity of the service worker. To mitigate this risk, it would be ideal to have the public key of the Internet Computer directly integrated into the hardware or browser! This would provide an expectional level of security and be a convenient option, giving users peace of mind and the confidence to trust the authenticity of the content they are accessing!"
## The `http_request` method
Once the boundary node has received the request. It will encode it into Candid and automatically call the http_request method of the canister. reachable by browsers, you need to implement an `http_request` method as part of the public interface of your  actor. <br/>

This is the minimum code needed to return a simple page that prints **Hello world**.
```motoko 
import Text "mo:base/Text";
import Http "http";
actor {
    public type HttpRequest = Http.HttpRequest;
    public type HttpResponse = Http.HttpResponse;

    public query func http_request(req : HttpRequest) : async HttpResponse {
        return({
            body = Text.encodeUtf8("Hello World");
            headers = [];
            status_code = 200;
            streaming_strategy = null;
        });
    };
};
```
Here is the content of the `HTTP` module, the file name is `http.mo`.
```motoko
module Http {
    public type HeaderField = (Text, Text);

    public type HttpRequest = {
        body: Blob;
        headers: [HeaderField];
        method: Text;
        url: Text;
    };

    public type HttpResponse = {
        body: Blob;
        headers: [HeaderField];
        status_code: Nat16;
        streaming_strategy: ?StreamingStrategy;
    };

    public type StreamingStrategy = {
        #Callback: {
            callback : StreamingCallback;
            token    : StreamingCallbackToken;
        };
    };

    public type StreamingCallback = query (StreamingCallbackToken) -> async (StreamingCallbackResponse);

    public type StreamingCallbackToken =  {
        content_encoding : Text;
        index            : Nat;
        key              : Text;
    };

    public type StreamingCallbackResponse = {
        body  : Blob;
        token : ?StreamingCallbackToken;
    };
}
```
